# Feldspar

## Architecture

- redis pub/sub
- node connection to redis
  - websocket to react FE
  - only facilitates redis <--> FE messages?
  - maybe calls to python fin model (below)
  - (un)subscribe to asset tickers
- .net core service
  - reads [commodity ticking data](https://www.alphavantage.co/)
  - pubs to redis
  - pull assets available to poll
  - receive subscriptions from node for which to poll
- python financial modeling
  - exposed via protocol buffer

## Notes

```sh
docker run -it -d -p 6379:6379 redis
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.debug.yml up --build
```

Docker Images: Build Image

https://{your site name}.scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole view env vars

in redis container
```sh
redis-cli
PUBLISH MarketData.Query "BRT|monthly"
```

if response.json() fails to parse, use response.text() to see what is actually getting returned

## Road Map

- [x] asset selector
  - [ ] pass asset query from web -> websocket -> redis pub -> retrieve redis sub -> websocket -> web
  - [] set curve colors but keep consistent
- [] saving selections to favorites
- [x] caching market data in redis - can set expiry
- [] restricting from/to dates
- [] deploy to azure
